# voxelreduction

voxelization is an implementation of my algorithm in 
http://archive.bridgesmathart.org/2012/bridges2012-523.pdf

It takes as input a file with a voxelization and returns a voxelization with half the resolution.

The input file should be a string of unseparated 0s and 1s for each voxel, listed from front-to-back, then left-to-right, then top-to-bottom.
